Course: SW Testing, Qual. Assur. and Maint

What challenges did you encounter with this assignment, if any? 

<b> The challenges I encountered with this assignment mainly had to do with the classification of triangles. I definitely had to google whether a right triangle was in the same category of classification as equilateral, scalene, and isosceles. I learned that scalene and isosceles triangles can be right triangles also, so I had to modify the code to accomodate that. </b>

What did you think about the requirements specification for this assignment?

<b> I thought the requirements specification for this assignment were a little bit vague. The fact that a right triangle got lumped in along with equilateral, scalene, and isosceles in the classification did not seem correct once I wrote my code based on that. 

What challenges did you encounter with the tools?

<b> I did not encounter any challenges with the tools since I used unittest in one of my classes already, as well as at one of my internships. 

Describe the criteria you used to determine that you had sufficient test cases, i.e. how did you know you were done?

<b> To determine that I had sufficient test cases, i.e. how I knew I was done, I made sure that I had more than 1 test case per triangle classification. This would make sure that I didn't just got lucky and had one pass the tests, when others may not have. </b>
